Covid scraper recording entries to the Google Cloud MySQL DB and visualizing data with pandas and Dash (Plotly, Flask).

### Event log
7/05/2020 - UA Gov Adopted a law on mass-testing

### Observations

**"Recovery Plateaus" during weekends**
While the infection and fatality rates are pretty consistent throught the whole period, the "Recovery" rate is regurarely entering "plateaus" during weekends (+/- 1 day). 

This could be caused by:
- more people addressing hospitals during weekends (increase in number of confirmed cases?)
- medical workers report less people recovering (decrease in recovery numbers?)
- more people die during weekends (increase in number of deaths?)
